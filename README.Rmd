`connectwidgets` is an R package that can be used to query a Posit Connect server for a subset of your existing content items, then organize them within `htmlwidget` components in an R Markdown document or Shiny application.

Use `connectwidgets` to create a content hub or knowledge repository, a customized summary page for a particular group of stakeholders, or a presentation layer for any group of related content. 

## Installation

You can install `connectwidgets` from CRAN using:

```r
install.packages("connectwidgets")
```

Alternatively, you can install the development version from GitHub:

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("rstudio/connectwidgets")
```

## Example

Use the template:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
rmarkdown::draft("example-page.Rmd", template = "connectwidgets", package = "connectwidgets")
```

You can also copy and knit the following example, or read on for more details:

library(dplyr)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)

client <- connect(
  # server  = Sys.getenv("CONNECT_SERVER"),
  # api_key = Sys.getenv("CONNECT_API_KEY")
  )

all_content <- client %>%
  content()

sample_content <- all_content %>%
  arrange(desc(updated_time)) %>%
  slice_head(n = 50)
```

```

### search & filter

```{r search-and-filter}`r ''`
rsc_cols(rsc_search(all_content), rsc_filter(all_content), widths = c(2, 2))
rsc_table(all_content)
```
````

### Setup

The client object:

- Validates your API key with the Posit Connect server
- Ensures you are running a recent enough version of Connect

Use an `.Renviron` file to set the `CONNECT_SERVER` and `CONNECT_API_KEY`
environment variables.
If you're not familiar with setting environment variables, check out the
[R Startup chapter](https://rstats.wtf/r-startup.html#renviron)
of What They Forgot to Teach You About R.
Posit Connect will [automatically apply](https://docs.rstudio.com/connect/user/content-settings/#content-vars)
values for these at document run time,
so there is no need to include them in your code:

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(connectwidgets)
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)

client <- connect(
  # server  = Sys.getenv("CONNECT_SERVER"),
  # api_key = Sys.getenv("CONNECT_API_KEY")
  )

all_content <- client %>%
  content()

glimpse(all_content)

sample_content <- all_content %>%
  arrange(desc(updated_time)) %>%
  slice_head(n = 100)
```

#### `content()`

`content()` returns a data frame with the following columns:

* `id` - Auto-incrementing identifier for each content item (legacy)
* `guid` - Unique identifier for each content item (preferred)
* `app_mode` - The type of the content item (examples: `shiny`, `rmd-static`, `static`, `python-dash`, etc.)
* `content_category` - For `static` app modes, the specific category of content (examples: `site`, `plot`, `pin`, etc.)
* `name` - The name of the content item as set at initial publishing
* `title` - The user-provided title of the content item
* `description` - The user-provided description of the content item
* `url` - The URL to the content item
* `owner_guid` - Unique identifier of the owner of the content item
* `owner_username` - Username of the owner of the content item
* `owner_first_name` - First name of the owner of the content item
* `owner_last_name` - Last name of the owner of the content item
* `tags` - A data frame of the tags associated with the content item, with the following columns: `id`, `name`, `parent_id`, `created_time`, `updated_time`.
* `created_time` - The timestamp at which the content item was created
* `updated_time` - The timestamp at which the content item was last updated

The data frame contains one row for each item visible to the requesting user.
For users in an "administrator" role, that will be all content items.

#### Filtering Content

We provide helper functions to filter by both owners and tags.

- `by_tags()` - Filters the data frame to only include content that has been
tagged with the specified tag name(s).  You can pass a single tag name or a vector
of tag names. `by_tag` is provided as an alias for readability when using a
single tag.

- `by_owners()` - Filters the data frame to only include content with the
specified owner(s) by username.  You can pass a single username or a vector of
usernames. `by_owner` is provided as an alias for readability when using a
single username.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
all_content %>% 
  by_tag("Audit Reports")
```

Since `all_content` is a `tibble()`, you can also manipulate it with dplyr:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
all_content %>% 
  filter(updated_time >= "2021-01-01") %>% 
  arrange(created_time)
```


### Components

Once your content data are filtered, `connectwidgets` provides components for
displaying information about them. The title, description, and preview image can be set
[from the Posit Connect dashboard.](https://docs.rstudio.com/connect/user/content-settings/#content-metadata)
For content deployed to Connect where no image has been supplied, a default image will be used.

*Note:* In many cases, you will only see default images until your content is deployed.

#### card

Use a card to highlight an individual piece of content:

![a sample card](man/figures/README-card-1.png)

#### grid

Display multiple content items via a grid:

![a sample grid](man/figures/README-grid-1.png)

#### table

Provide a more detailed view with a table:

![a sample table](man/figures/README-table-1.png)

#### search & filter

The search and filter components help viewers find the content they are most interested in.
You must pass the same content data frame to `rsc_search()`, `rsc_filter()`,
and `rsc_table()` or `rsc_grid()` in order for filter and search to work.
You can also create your own `crosstalk::SharedData()` object to pass to
the components if you want more control over searching and filtering.
Read more at `vignette("using-crosstalk")`.

## Theming

`connectwidgets` components support styling in `rmarkdown::html_document` via the [`bslib`](https://rstudio.github.io/bslib/) package.
You can supply a [Bootswatch theme](https://bootswatch.com/4/) in the yaml header, e.g.:

```yaml
---
output:
  html_document:
    theme:
      bootswatch: minty
---
```

or pass a custom theme consistent with your organization's style:

```yaml:
---
output:
  html_document:
    theme:
      bg: "#FFF"
      fg: "#22333B" 
      primary: "#4F772D"
      dark: "#252525"
      light: "#DCE6D3"
      base_font: "Lato, sans-serif"
      heading_font: "Lato, sans-serif"
      border-color: "#E9F5DB"
      gray-100: "#F7FCF0"
---
```

Once you're happy with the look of your page, Publish it to Posit Connect.
Read more at `vignette("publishing")`.

## A more customized example:

Putting it all together, the example API portal page below:

- uses CSS to create a full-width image with inset text
- uses a Bootswatch theme
- overrides the `description` text for a couple of cards

If no APIs are deployed on your Posit Connect server,
try filtering for static documents or Shiny apps instead.
