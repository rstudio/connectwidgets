Once your Pages are built and [published](https://docs.rstudio.com/connect/user/publishing/#publishing-documents),
you have a few options for keeping them up to date:

## Scheduled RMarkdown

Publish the page with source, and [schedule it](https://docs.rstudio.com/connect/user/scheduling/#schedule-type)
to update periodically.

## `runtime: shiny`

If you want your page to reflect changes to your content whenever it is visited,
you can add `runtime: shiny` to the yaml frontmatter of your RMarkdown document.

``` {.yaml}
title: an example page
ouput: html_document
runtime: shiny
```

## Shiny App

Since Pages components are htmlwidgets, you can use them to build a shiny app.
